      "CEO of the Joker Company and a Mechatronic engineer with hands-on experience gained dealing with deep learning and neuroimaging projects related to find biomarkers that can help to diagnose the alzheimer's disease through the analysis of MRI and the development of an AI app (Python). I really like the information technology world (TI), not only for frontend app development but also for development and deployment of artificial intelligence models as web apps, currently working as a React developer.",

    about:
      "CEO of the Joker Company. As biomedical engineer anatomy and physiology are just two of my hobbies. I like sports, nature and technology and I try to mix those things with medicine and IA to create powerful software tools with nice interfaces that people could use easily. I like simplicity and saving time to spent it in important things so I let Python do tasks automation and the real heavy work. I really enjoy learning about neurolgy, even I've got MRI processing background with software tools like 3D Slicer, Freesurfer, FSL and my I want to go deepest in the biomedical images world. Also I'm working on IA and deep learning models deployment",
